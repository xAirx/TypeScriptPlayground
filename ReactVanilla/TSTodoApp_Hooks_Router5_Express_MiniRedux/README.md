## Hooks Context Suspense (MiniRedux - useReducer and Context)

Using Typescript with modern React (i.e. hooks, context, suspense)

a react project from scratch with webpack and babel. You will learn a bit about react hooks, (useState, useContext, useReducer and useEffect), in a react
typescript project as well as using suspense to lazy load a component. We will also attempt to recreate redux, (or the redux principles) with useReducer and Context.
