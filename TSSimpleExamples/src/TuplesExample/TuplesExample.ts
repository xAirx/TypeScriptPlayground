	/*   So here we also have an example where typescript doesn't fir a type but we explicitly want to override
  it.

  Now here we can therefore add an explicit object type by adding a colon after person then the curly
  braces and then name should be a string.
  Age should be a number and Hobbes should be a string array so all as inferred by typescript.

  So for that we wouldn't have required this explicit assignment.
  And as you learn it would have been bad.

  But now we have a scenario where the inference does not work in the way we want and we want to set roll
  to be a tuple.

  Now instead of setting a two string array or number array we're using the same type that was inferred
  here earlier.

  We can now use a special type.
  We use square brackets again but now inside of the square brackets we add no and then a comma and then

  string.
  Now this marks a tuple type here a tuple is a special construct typescript understands in JavaScript

This would work because typescript only knows that role should be of type String or no array and therefore

person3.role = ['test', 'test', 'test']; // error first one has to be number
person3.role = [1, 'test', 'test']; // Error there is no 3rd type.

/*
assigning a number here to the second element and therefore replacing it with a number would be allowed
because we're just saying something about the types we generally can use in there.

We know we want to have exactly that structure two elements first element no second element string but
typescript doesn't do that well for such a scenario.

A tuple would be perfect we can tell typescript what role should be by explicitly setting the type of
role.

So here we also have an example where typescript doesn't fir a type but we explicitly want to override

it. */
